For my addition I added a jump button for both players.  
B for Player 1.
Right Shift for Player 2.

I also added a giant tree in the middle of the playing field.

The jump button is a little glitchy because I tried to make it so they couldn't jump while in the air and my collision back with
the ground doesn't seem to be measured properly all the time but I don't fully understand how to fix it.  So at some points on
the map the players can jump fine but other times the jump button is unresponsive.
